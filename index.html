          >Working across Kenya, our projects include anti-poaching, safe
          guarding the natural environment, enhancing community awareness,
          addressing animal welfare issues, providing veterinary assistance to
          animals in need, rescuing and hand rearing elephant and rhino orphans,
          along with other species that can ultimately enjoy a quality of life
          in wild terms when grown.</strong
